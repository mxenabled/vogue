# Vogue

Keep your dependencies fashionably up-to-date.

## What is this?

Vogue is a gradle plugin that reads and processes reports generated by the [gradle-versions-plugin](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin). This is intended to be used as a "gatekeeper" to prevent dependencies from getting too far out of date while also providing utilities to easily upgrade outdated dependencies.

## Deploying Locally

To create a local build of the accessor to use in connector services use

```shell
$ ./gradlew clean publishToMavenLocal
```
This will create a local build in your local maven repository that you can
then reference in other services.

On OXS using gradle the default location for the local maven repository is
```shell
~/.m2/repository/com/mx/vogue/
```
